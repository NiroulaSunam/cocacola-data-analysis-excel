# Coca-Cola Financial Data Analysis (Excel Project)

📊 **Project Title:** Coca-Cola 10-Year Financial Report — Data Cleaning and Analysis in Excel

📁 **Tools Used:** Microsoft Excel (Data Cleaning, Pivot Tables, Analysis)

## 📌 Project Summary

This project involved cleaning and analyzing Coca-Cola’s financial statements from **FY 2009–FY 2018**, including:

- **Profit & Loss Statement**
- **Balance Sheet**
- **Cash Flow Statement**

The raw data contained mixed formats, merged cells, subtotal lines, manual sums, and inconsistent groupings. I manually cleaned the dataset and transformed it into structured tables for analysis and pivoting.

## Key Tasks Performed

### 1. Data Cleaning

- Extracted and separated each financial statement from a single mixed sheet
- Removed unnecessary subtotals and non-tabular rows
- Standardized column and rows
- Added categorical columns for grouping (e.g., Revenue, Expense, Income, Assets, Liabilities)
- Unified formatting for numbers, categories, and missing data

### 2. Profit & Loss Statement

- Grouped financial items by **Revenue**, **Expenses**, and **Income**
- Calculated net values and confirmed totals with original statements
- Created a clean, structured table ready for pivoting and visualization

### 3. Balance Sheet

- Split into **Assets** and **Liabilities & Equity**
- Categorized values as **Current**, **Non-current**, or **Intangible**
- Validated yearly totals and adjusted for discrepancies manually

### 4. Cash Flow Statement

- Organized into:

  - Operating Activities
  - Investing Activities
  - Financing Activities
  - Discontinued Operations

- Identified and grouped related items logically
- Added categories for cleaner analysis

## 5. Analysis Performed

- Created Pivot Tables to summarize:

  - Revenue vs. Expense vs. Income trends over 10 years
  - Asset composition over time (Current vs. Non-current vs. Intangibles)
  - Debt and equity structure changes across years

- Set up slicers for fiscal year comparison (planned for Tableau)
- Explored potential for interactive dashboards

## What's Next?

I will be visualizing this cleaned dataset in **Tableau** with:

- Interactive bar charts, line graphs, and KPI cards
- Year-based slicers for trend comparison
- Financial ratio visualization (e.g., profit margins, ROA, ROE)
